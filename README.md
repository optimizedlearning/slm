# Simple Small Language Model Training

This repo is an attempt to set up training of a language model on the pile using huggingface, wandb and pytorch lightning.
The model is GPT3, with comments describing where the various architectural decision came from in the paper.

To run: if you are BU's SCC, you can start with `source scc_setup.sh`.

Then `python gpt_pile.py`.
